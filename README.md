#  Quantity Measurement Application

A Java-based application that demonstrates measurement equality comparison using object-oriented principles.

---
## UC1: Feet Measurement Equality

## Description
Checks equality of two numerical values in feet, handling null, type mismatch, and floating-point precision.

## Flow
1. Input two numerical values in feet.
2. Validate inputs are numeric.
3. Compare for equality → return `true` or `false`.

## Key Concepts
- Override `equals()` using `Double.compare()` instead of `==`
- `private final` field for immutability
- Null & type safety to prevent exceptions

---

## UC2: Feet and Inches Measurement Equality

## Description
Extends UC1 to support equality checks for both Feet and Inches independently using separate classes. Reduces main method dependency via static helper methods.

## Flow
1. Static method validates two feet values → compares equality.
2. Static method validates two inches values → compares equality.
3. Returns `true` / `false` for each comparison.

## Key Concepts
- Separate `Inches` class mirroring `Feet` (same equality logic)
- Static methods for Feet and Inches equality checks
- Violates DRY principle (addressed in UC3)

---

## UC3: Generic Quantity Class (DRY Principle)

## Description
Refactors Feet and Inches into a single `QuantityLength` class using a `LengthUnit` enum. Eliminates code duplication and supports cross-unit equality (e.g., 1 foot == 12 inches).

## Flow
1. Input value + unit type → validate.
2. Convert both values to base unit (feet).
3. Compare converted values → return `true` / `false`.

## Key Concepts
- `LengthUnit` enum with conversion factors
- Single class handles all unit types (DRY)
- Cross-unit equality via base unit normalization

---

## UC4: Extended Unit Support (Yards & Centimeters)

## Description
Extends UC3 by adding YARDS (1 yd = 3 ft) and CENTIMETERS (1 cm = 0.393701 in) to the `LengthUnit` enum. No changes to `QuantityLength` class required.

## Flow
1. Input value + unit (feet/inches/yards/cm) → validate.
2. Convert both to base unit (feet).
3. Compare → return `true` / `false`.

## Conversion Factors
| Unit | Factor (to feet) |
|------|-----------------|
| YARDS | 3.0 |
| CENTIMETERS | ~0.0328 |

---

## UC5: Unit-to-Unit Conversion

## Description
Extends UC4 by exposing an explicit `convert(value, sourceUnit, targetUnit)` method. Normalizes to base unit (feet) then converts to target unit. Introduces method overloading and JavaDoc documentation.

## Flow
1. Validate value (finite), sourceUnit and targetUnit (non-null).
2. Convert value → base unit using `sourceUnit.getConversionFactor()`.
3. Convert base unit → target using `targetUnit.getConversionFactor()`.
4. Return converted numeric value.

## Key Concepts
- Method overloading: `demonstrateLengthConversion(double, LengthUnit, LengthUnit)` and `(QuantityLength, LengthUnit)`
- Private helper methods for encapsulation
- `toString()` override for readability
- Formula: `result = value × (source.factor / target.factor)`

---

## UC6: Addition of Two Length Units

## Description
Extends UC5 by adding two `QuantityLength` objects (potentially different units). Result is expressed in the unit of the first operand. Both operands are normalized to base unit before summing.

## Flow
1. Validate both operands (non-null, finite, valid units).
2. Convert both to base unit (feet).
3. Sum converted values.
4. Convert sum → first operand's unit.
5. Return new `QuantityLength` (immutability preserved).

## Key Concepts
- Immutability: addition returns new instance
- Commutativity: `add(A, B)` = `add(B, A)`
- Method overloading for flexible API

---

## UC7: Addition with Explicit Target Unit

## Description
Extends UC6 by allowing the caller to specify any supported unit as the result unit, regardless of the operands' units. Uses a private utility method to avoid code duplication across overloaded `add()` methods.

## Flow
1. Validate operands and target unit (non-null, finite).
2. Convert both to base unit → sum.
3. Convert sum → explicitly specified `targetUnit`.
4. Return new `QuantityLength` in target unit.

## Key Concepts
- Method overloading: `add(l1, l2)` implicit vs `add(l1, l2, targetUnit)` explicit
- Private utility method eliminates DRY violation between overloads
- Commutativity holds for any target unit

---

## UC8: Refactoring LengthUnit to Standalone Enum

## Description
Extracts `LengthUnit` from inside `QuantityLength` into a standalone top-level class. Assigns conversion responsibility to the enum itself. `QuantityLength` is simplified to delegate all conversions to unit methods. All UC1–UC7 functionality preserved.

## Flow
1. `LengthUnit` enum handles `convertToBaseUnit()` and `convertFromBaseUnit()`.
2. `QuantityLength` delegates all conversions to unit methods.
3. Public API remains unchanged → backward compatible.

## Key Concepts
- Single Responsibility: `LengthUnit` converts, `QuantityLength` compares/adds
- Eliminates circular dependency for multi-category scaling
- Pattern template for future `WeightUnit`, `VolumeUnit`, etc.

---

## UC9: Weight Measurement (Equality, Conversion & Addition)

## Description
Introduces a new `WeightUnit` enum and `QuantityWeight` class mirroring the UC8 length pattern. Supports equality, conversion, and addition for KILOGRAM, GRAM, and POUND. Weight and length are incompatible categories.

## Conversion Factors (base: KILOGRAM)
| Unit | Factor |
|------|--------|
| KILOGRAM | 1.0 |
| GRAM | 0.001 |
| POUND | 0.453592 |

## Key Concepts
- `WeightUnit` standalone enum with `convertToBaseUnit()` / `convertFromBaseUnit()`
- Category type safety: `Quantity(1.0, KG).equals(Quantity(1.0, FOOT))` → `false`
- Overloaded `add()`: implicit (first operand unit) and explicit (target unit)
- `hashCode()` overridden consistently with `equals()`

---

## UC10: Generic Quantity Class with IMeasurable Interface

## Description
Refactors `QuantityLength` and `QuantityWeight` into a single generic `Quantity<U extends IMeasurable>` class. Eliminates code duplication across categories using a common interface. All UC1–UC9 functionality preserved.

## Architecture
| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------------|
| `IMeasurable` | Defines unit conversion contract |
| `LengthUnit` / `WeightUnit` | Implement `IMeasurable` with conversion factors |
| `Quantity<U>` | Handles equality, conversion, addition for any unit |
| `QuantityMeasurementApp` | Generic demonstration only |

## Key Concepts
- Bounded type parameter `<U extends IMeasurable>` for compile-time type safety
- Cross-category prevention via `unit.getClass()` comparison
- `equals()`, `convertTo()`, `add()` implemented once — reused for all categories
- Adding new categories requires ONLY a new enum implementing `IMeasurable`

---

## UC11: Volume Measurement (Litre, Millilitre, Gallon)

## Description
Adds a third measurement category — volume — by creating a `VolumeUnit` enum implementing `IMeasurable`. No changes to `Quantity<U>`, `QuantityMeasurementApp`, or existing tests required. Proves the UC10 architecture scales linearly.

## Conversion Factors (base: LITRE)
| Unit | Factor |
|------|--------|
| LITRE | 1.0 |
| MILLILITRE | 0.001 |
| GALLON | 3.78541 |

## Key Concepts
- Only a new enum needed to add a full measurement category
- Cross-category safety: `1.0 LITRE ≠ 1.0 KILOGRAM` and `1.0 LITRE ≠ 1.0 FOOT`
- All generic `Quantity<U>` operations work automatically

---

## UC12: Subtraction and Division Operations

## Description
Extends `Quantity<U>` with subtraction (returns `Quantity<U>`) and division (returns dimensionless `double`). Both operations support cross-unit arithmetic within the same category and maintain immutability.

## Operations
| Method | Returns | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `subtract(other)` | `Quantity<U>` | Result in first operand's unit |
| `subtract(other, targetUnit)` | `Quantity<U>` | Result in explicit unit |
| `divide(other)` | `double` | Dimensionless ratio |

## Key Concepts
- Subtraction is **non-commutative**: `A - B ≠ B - A`
- Division is **non-commutative**: `A ÷ B ≠ B ÷ A`
- Division by zero throws `ArithmeticException`
- Cross-category operations throw `IllegalArgumentException`

---

# UC13: Centralized Arithmetic Logic (DRY Refactoring)

## Description
Refactors UC12's `add()`, `subtract()`, and `divide()` to eliminate duplicated validation and conversion logic by introducing a centralized private helper method and an `ArithmeticOperation` enum. Public API is unchanged; all UC12 behavior preserved.

## Internal Architecture
| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `ArithmeticOperation` enum | Dispatches ADD, SUBTRACT, DIVIDE via `compute(a, b)` |
| `validateArithmeticOperands()` | Centralized null, category, finiteness checks |
| `performBaseArithmetic()` | Converts to base unit → executes operation → returns result |

## Two Enum Styles Supported
- **Abstract method**: Each constant overrides `compute()` — clean for complex logic
- **Lambda (`DoubleBinaryOperator`)**: Concise, modern functional style

## Key Concepts
- All validation defined once → consistent errors across all operations
- Adding future operations (MULTIPLY, MODULO) requires only a new enum constant
- Private helpers reduce each public method to 2–3 lines
- All UC12 tests pass without modification

## UC14: Temperature Measurement & Interface Refactoring  

### Description: Integrated Temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit) while refactoring the IMeasurable interface to handle non-linear math and restricted operations.  

Key Features:  

> Refactored IMeasurable with Default Methods to make arithmetic operations optional.  
> Used Lambda Expressions to handle the complex Fahrenheit-to-Celsius and Celcius-to-Farenheit formulas.  

---   


## UC15: N-Tier Layering & Persistence  
### Description:  
Transformed the monolithic structure into a decoupled, 4-tier architecture to support scalability, data persistence, and API-readiness.  

Key Features:  
> Controller Layer: Acts as the entry point, receiving and routing requests using standardized Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).  
> Service Layer: The "Central Brain." It handles the mapping between DTOs and Domain Models, executes UC1–UC14 business logic, and orchestrates data persistence.  
> Repository Layer: Implemented as a Singleton with File-based serialization (.ser) to provide a persistent audit trail of all measurements.  
> DTO (Data Transfer Object): Introduced a "dumb" data carrier to decouple the internal domain logic from external interfaces.  
> Domain Model (QuantityModel): A "Smart" internal object used strictly for execution, maintaining the type safety provided by IMeasurable.  
> Entity Model (QuantityMeasurementEntity): A dedicated data structure for long-term storage, capturing operation metadata (timestamps, success/error flags).
