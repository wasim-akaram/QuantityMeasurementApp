# Quantity Measurement Application  

A Java-based application that demonstrates measurement equality comparison using object-oriented principles.  
---  


## UC1: Feet Measurement Equality  
### Description  
Checks equality of two numerical values in feet, handling null, type mismatch, and floating-point precision.  

Flow  
> Input two numerical values in feet.  
> Validate inputs are numeric.  
> Compare for equality → return true or false.  

Key Concepts  
> Override equals() using Double.compare() instead of ==  
> private final field for immutability  
> Null & type safety to prevent exceptions  
---    



## UC2: Feet and Inches Measurement Equality  
### Description  
Extends UC1 to support equality checks for both Feet and Inches independently using separate classes. Reduces main method dependency via static helper methods.  

Flow  
> Static method validates two feet values → compares equality.  
> Static method validates two inches values → compares equality.  
> Returns true / false for each comparison.  

Key Concepts  
> Separate Inches class mirroring Feet (same equality logic)  
> Static methods for Feet and Inches equality checks  
> Violates DRY principle

## UC3: Generic Quantity Class (DRY Principle)  
### Description  
Refactors Feet and Inches into a single QuantityLength class using a LengthUnit enum. Eliminates code duplication and supports cross-unit equality (e.g., 1 foot == 12 inches).  
 
Flow  
> Input value + unit type → validate.  
> Convert both values to base unit (feet).  
> Compare converted values → return true / false.  

Key Concepts  
> LengthUnit enum with conversion factors  
> Single class handles all unit types (DRY)  
> Cross-unit equality via base unit normalization
